# fast-js
Example of writing C++ modules for node

1. make sure your have node 13.12.0 installed (or update the node engines variable with your version)
2. `$ npm install` or `$ npm i` (shorthand)
3. run the project with `$ npm start`

## What does it do?
This example aims to compare the speed at which we do the same operations in C++ and JavaScript.

The operations include the following:
- iterate over a large number count
- change a value of an number/integer on the program stack
- print a string of "hello\n" to standard output (stdout)
